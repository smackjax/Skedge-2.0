## The idea:
###### Equal load distribution for all
This app is for any circumstance where there is a list of tasks need to be done on a certain day each week, and a limited pool to choose from. For instance: 
* Employees
* Household chores
* Band practice
* Puppy training
* Bee keeping
* etc...

#### What it does
Organizes people by groups, which are then assigned to fill tasks, which are needed on a certain day, for a set amount of days. 

#### The goal
Use the people available to fill each task, and evenly distribute the load between people assigned to the task.
For example, never having one person who's done it fifty times and another who's only done it once.
